MECH-2400 Spring 2025 - Final Project
Dr. Wilburn


Lets take a tour of the deliverables:

The master file, the assembly with realistic motion, can be found within the file "Ender 3 Pro Assembly" in the root of the folder.

The individual components are then broken up into sub-folders based on their location in the assembly. These sub-folders include:
"Aluminum Extrusions, Extruder, Filament Holder, Hotend Assembly*, LCD Support, Miscellaneous Hardware, Power Supply, 
Sheetmetal Enclosures, Stepper Motor 42mm, X-Axis Supporting Cast, Y-Axis Supporting Cast, Z-Axis Supporting Cast"

*(Hotend Assembly may be redundant but honestly I am afraid to delete it because I dont know what depends on it.)


The drawing sets are found in the "Part Drawings" folder. Inside that file are two notes
"Part Drawings" -
	Various Part Drawings (Inventor Native .dwg Files)
	"Exploded Views" - 
		Various Assembly Drawings (Exploded View, and Inventor Native .dwg Files)
		"PDF" (Contains the PDF formatted assembly drawings)
	"PDF" (Contains the PDF formatted part drawings)
	partDrawings.pdf (Compiled list of all the part AND assembly drawings in one .pdf file)

Assembly videos can be found in the "Presentations" -> "Videos" folder
"Presentations" - 
	Various Assembly Files (Inventor Native .ipn Files)
	IMPORTANT NOTE: In this subfolder there is "fullAssembly.ipn" that is the non-moving full assembly that is constructed with the other sub-assemblies
	"Videos" (This contains the .wmv video files of 4 of the sub-asssemblies. If you want a more polished viewing experience, I would watch "xAxisAssemblyPresentation.wmv" or "extruderAssemblyPresentation.wmv"
	
The screenshots of the parts can be found in "Part Images". There will be hopefully self-explaning .pdf's that compile the photos, there will also be "Individual Images" which will contain....the individual images.
	
'Fun' things to note: (NOT NECESSARILY RELEVANT TO GRADING)
	The construction of relevant iProperties with naming scheme and decent descriptions. (Please, I spent too long on it, it had to look good on the BOM.)
		If interested there is a naming scheme which is as follows:
			BKT - Bracket
			PLT - Plate
			MTR - Motors
			EXT - Extrusions
			SPC - Spacers
			SCR - Screws & Bolts
			BRG - Bearings
			BSF - Build Surfaces
			SWT - Switches
			SMC - Sheet Metal
			PHR - Placeholders
			ASM - Assembly
	
	My favorite file, and the best BOM, lives in:
		"Part Drawings"  -
			"Exploded Views" -
				"Ender 3 Pro Assembly.dwg"
				
				
Less fun just rambling, attempting to relay how confusing I think the files are.
	Most important thing is the main assembly which will be in a Pack and Go, this assembly will contain all the parts, and have realistic motion.
	
	Next I will attempt to Pack and Go the "fullAssembly" because that contains the necessary sub-assemblies for the various exploded views
	
	Hopefully the part drawings and presentations will go with one or both of those Pack and Go's but just in case I will attach a basic .zip of my root project folder. Which if you are reading this, you got in.
